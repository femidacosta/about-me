# about-me

_About me project_

I have enjoyed the about me project. I found the JS challenging but my understanding of `for ` loops, `while` loops and `array` has improved.

I have enjoyed the CSS aspect of the project.

The current score of my about me page it _76%_ tested with Lighthouse.

I can ensure a higher score by making these changes;

- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. Make sure the colors are contrasted for people who have impaired vision.

- Adding Alt tags to any image including the logo.

- Custom controls have associated labels ( as the nav bar needs to be completed!)
