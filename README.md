# about-me

_About me project_

I have enjoyed the about me project. I found the JS challenging but my understanding of `for ` loops, `while` loops and `array` has improved.

I have enjoyed the CSS aspect of the project.

The current score of my about me page it _76%_ tested with Lighthouse.

I can ensure a higher score by making these changes;

- Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. Make sure the colors are contrasted for people who have impaired vision.

- Adding Alt tags to any image including the logo.

- Custom controls have associated labels ( as the nav bar needs to be completed!)

<img src="about me/lighthouse 1.png" class="image"/>

**css**

-I have added a video that I downloaded and colour edited to use as the landing page of my about me page with a `transparent` navigation bar.

- The title of the page has a ` color:transparency;` feature as the mouse hovers over it.

-I made my own logo and images for this site by colour matching a duotone palette to the images chosen.
These images will now be put onto the different sections on the website.

-I have created a `scroll-snap` where each section will 'snap' to the top of the page, I think this is a nice feature to have on a site to keep things clear.

-Changed the cursor from a pointer to a crosswire.

Although another video has been added to the page - I am yet to figure out how to see it.
